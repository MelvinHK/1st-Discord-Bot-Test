# 1st-Test-Discord-Bot
First Discord bot I made for testing stuff

Install dotenv and add an .env file with the environmental variable:

BOT_TOKEN = 'your Discord bot token'

Current commands:

  - !ping - shows ping in milliseconds

  - !cat - shows random img of a cat using a random cat image API

Planned stuff:
  - experiment with league of legends API
